# STGNNs: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Climate Data Analysis

## Overview
STGNNs is a Python-based implementation of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks designed for analyzing and predicting climate data. This model combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and advanced temporal modeling to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in meteorological data.

## Key Features
- Preprocessing of climate data
- Construction of spatial graphs using KD-trees
- Implementation of STGNNs model
- Training and evaluation pipelines
- Data correction using trained models

## Installation
Please refer to the `INSTALL.md` file for detailed installation instructions.

## Usage
To run a demo of the STGNNs model:

```bash
python demo.py
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the comments in `STGNNs.py`.
